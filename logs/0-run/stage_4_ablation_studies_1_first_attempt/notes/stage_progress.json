Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Model Architecture and Training Adjustments**: Increasing the number of training epochs and adjusting the model architecture by adding more layers and units have proven effective in capturing complex relationships in the data. This approach consistently led to improved training and validation metrics.\n\n- **Ablation Studies**: Conducting ablation studies, such as varying activation functions, model architecture, and dataset noise levels, provided valuable insights into the model's robustness and performance under different conditions. These studies helped identify optimal configurations and highlighted the importance of model flexibility.\n\n- **Data Normalization**: Ensuring that input data is properly normalized was crucial for model performance. This step helped stabilize training and improved the model's ability to learn meaningful patterns from the data.\n\n- **Synthetic Dataset Variations**: Using multiple synthetic datasets with varying distributions and noise levels allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of model robustness. This approach demonstrated the model's ability to generalize across different data patterns.\n\n- **Metric Tracking and Evaluation**: Consistently tracking metrics such as Hydrogen Bonding Interaction Score (HBIS) and Hydrogen Bonding Density (HBD) provided a clear measure of model performance and facilitated comparisons across different experiments.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Shape Mismatch Errors**: A recurring issue was shape mismatch errors during matrix multiplication in the forward pass of the model. These errors often arose from incorrect feature selection or hardcoded input dimensions that did not align with the dataset's feature size.\n\n- **Improper Metric Calculations**: The calculation of the Hydrogen Bonding Interaction Score (HBIS) was problematic in several experiments. Using the formula `1 - nn.MSELoss()(y_pred, y_true).item()` led to negative values, which are conceptually incorrect for a metric expected to be bounded between 0 and 1.\n\n- **Feature Selection Issues**: Incorrect handling of feature subsets during ablation studies resulted in shape mismatches and errors. Ensuring that the model dynamically adjusts to the number of selected features is crucial.\n\n- **Dataset Creation Bugs**: Errors in dataset creation functions, such as incorrect handling of parameters like 'feature_correlation', led to execution failures. Ensuring compatibility between parameters and data shapes is essential.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Dynamic Model Configuration**: Implement dynamic configuration of model input dimensions to accommodate varying feature sizes during ablation studies. This will prevent shape mismatch errors and improve model flexibility.\n\n- **Refined Metric Definitions**: Redefine the Hydrogen Bonding Interaction Score (HBIS) to ensure it remains within a valid range and provides meaningful insights into model performance. Consider alternative metrics that align with scientific interpretations of bonding interactions.\n\n- **Comprehensive Normalization**: Continue to prioritize data normalization across all experiments to ensure consistent and stable model training. This step is crucial for achieving reliable results.\n\n- **Robust Dataset Creation**: Ensure that dataset creation functions handle parameters correctly and are compatible with the intended data shapes. This will prevent execution errors and facilitate more accurate evaluations.\n\n- **Expanded Ablation Studies**: Continue exploring ablation studies with a focus on hyperparameter variations, such as learning rates, batch sizes, and dropout rates. This will provide deeper insights into optimal model configurations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from the failures, leading to more robust and effective model development."
