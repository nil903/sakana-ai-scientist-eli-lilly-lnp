Without dropout, the model achieves low loss and HBD metrics for both training and validation, indicating good generalization. However, introducing dropout results in slightly slower convergence and a consistent gap between training and validation metrics, showcasing its regularization effect. Overall, dropout enhances generalization by preventing overfitting, as evidenced by the lower validation metrics in the dropout-enabled model.","datasets_successfully_tested":["[\"without_dropout\"","\"with_dropout\"]"],"ablation_name":null,"hyperparam_name":null,"is_seed_node":false,"is_seed_agg_node":false,"exec_time_feedback":""},{"code":"import os\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset\n\n# Set up working directories and GPU/CPU\nworking_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"working\")\nos.makedirs(working_dir, exist_ok=True)\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\nprint(f\"Using device: {device}\")\n\n\ndef generate_synthetic_data(num_samples, num_features, noise_level, label_distribution):\n    features = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_features)\n    if label_distribution == \"uniform\":\n        labels = (\n            np.sum(features, axis=1)\n            + np.random.uniform(-noise_level, noise_level, num_samples)\n        ).clip(0, 10)\n    elif label_distribution == \"normal\":\n        labels = (\n            np.sum(features, axis=1) + np.random.normal(0, noise_level, num_samples)\n        ).clip(0, 10)\n    return features, labels\n\n\n# Generate multiple synthetic datasets\ndatasets = {\n    \"dataset_1\": generate_synthetic_data(2000, 10, 0.1, \"normal\"),\n    \"dataset_2\": generate_synthetic_data(2000, 15, 0.2, \"uniform\"),\n    \"dataset_3\": generate_synthetic_data(2000, 10, 0.3, \"normal\"),\n}\n\n# Experiment data storage\nexperiment_data = {\"multi_dataset_evaluation\": {}}\n\n\n# Model definition\nclass HydrogenBondModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(HydrogenBondModel, self).__init__()\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 64)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 32)\n        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(32, 16)\n        self.fc4 = nn.Linear(16, 1)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))\n        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))\n        x = torch.relu(self.fc3(x))\n        return self.fc4(x)\n\n\n# Hydrogen Bonding Interaction Score (HBIS) function\ndef calculate_hbis(y_true, y_pred):\n    return 1 -

execution failed due to a shape mismatch error during matrix multiplication in the forward pass of the model. Specifically, the input tensor had a shape of (32x15), but the first layer of the model expected an input size of 10 (as defined in the model's fc1 layer). This mismatch occurred because the dataset 'dataset_2' has 15 features, while the model is hardcoded to expect 10 features. To fix this issue, modify the model definition to dynamically adjust the input size of the first layer based on the dataset's feature size. Alternatively, ensure all datasets have a consistent feature size of 10 to match the model's current configuration.","exp_results_dir":null,"metric":{"value":null,"maximize":null,"name":null,"description":null},"is_buggy":true,"is_buggy_plots":null,"parent_id":null,"children":[],"plot_data":{},"plots_generated":false,"plots":[],"plot_paths":[],"plot_analyses":[],"vlm_feedback_summary":[],"datasets_successfully_tested":[],"ablation_name":"MULTI_DATASET_EVALUATION","hyperparam_name":null,"is_seed_node":false,"is_seed_agg_node":false,"exec_time_feedback":""},{"code":"import os\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Set up working directories and GPU/CPU\nworking_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"working\")\nos.makedirs(working_dir, exist_ok=True)\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\nprint(f\"Using device: {device}\")\n\n# Synthetic data generation\nnp.random.seed(0)\nnum_samples = 2000\nfeatures = np.random.rand(num_samples, 10)\nlabels = (np.sum(features, axis=1) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, num_samples)).clip(0, 10)\n\n# Create dataset\ndataset = TensorDataset(\n    torch.FloatTensor(features).to(device),\n    torch.FloatTensor(labels).to(device).view(-1, 1),\n)\n\n\n# Model definition\nclass HydrogenBondModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(HydrogenBondModel, self).__init__()\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 64)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 32)\n        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(32, 16)\n        self.fc4 = nn.Linear(16, 1)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))\n        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))\n        x = torch.relu(self.fc3(x))\n        return self.fc4(x)\n\n\n# Experiment data storage\nexperiment_data = {\"input_feature_selection\": {}}\n\n\n# Hydrogen Bonding Interaction Score (HBIS) function\ndef calculate_hbis(y_true, y_pred):\n    return 1 -

Both curves stabilize at near-zero values after initial fluctuations, with periodic sharp drops. These drops are consistent with the patterns observed in other HBIS and loss plots, likely due to a cyclic training process or resets. The close match between training and validation HBIS curves indicates no overfitting, but the periodic drops should be further investigated to confirm they are an intentional feature of the training strategy.","plot_path":"experiments/2026-02-06_07-43-32_eli_lilly_lnp_1_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_d9425c15712b4d0f9c625fbbb25e9ed4_proc_2884/exponential_hbis_curves.png"}],"vlm_feedback_summary":"The provided plots reveal consistent periodic behavior across multiple metrics, including loss and HBIS scores for both training and validation. This periodicity suggests a cyclic training process, possibly involving learning rate schedules or parameter resets. The alignment between training and validation curves across all plots indicates good generalization, with no evidence of overfitting. However, the periodic spikes and drops warrant further investigation to ensure they align with the intended experimental design and do not indicate instability.","datasets_successfully_tested":["[\"MULTI_DISTRIBUTION_LEARNING\"]"],"ablation_name":null,"hyperparam_name":null,"is_seed_node":false,"is_seed_agg_node":false,"exec_time_feedback":""},{"code":"import os\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset\n\n# Set up working directories and GPU/CPU\nworking_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"working\")\nos.makedirs(working_dir, exist_ok=True)\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\nprint(f\"Using device: {device}\")\n\n# Synthetic data generation\nnp.random.seed(0)\nnum_samples = 2000\nfeatures = np.random.rand(num_samples, 10)\nlabels = (np.sum(features, axis=1) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, num_samples)).clip(0, 10)\n\n# Create tensors\nfeatures_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(features).to(device)\nlabels_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(labels).to(device).view(-1, 1)\n\n# Create dataset and dataloaders\ndataset = TensorDataset(features_tensor, labels_tensor)\ntrain_size = int(0.8 * len(dataset))\nval_size = len(dataset) -
