  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successful experiments often involved systematic hyperparameter tuning, particularly with weight decay (L2 regularization), which consistently led to improved model performance. The smallest training loss was achieved with the highest weight decay value, indicating effective regularization.\n\n- **Integration of Validation Steps**: Incorporating detailed validation steps alongside training helped in monitoring both training and validation losses, minimizing overfitting, and ensuring the model's learning was effective.\n\n- **Enhanced Model Complexity and Dataset Size**: Increasing the model complexity (more layers and units) and expanding the dataset size significantly improved the statistical power and the model's ability to capture complex relationships in the data.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Tracking**: Successful experiments included comprehensive metrics logging, which facilitated thorough evaluation and monitoring of performance over epochs. This included tracking training and validation losses, accuracy, and the Hydrogen Bonding Interaction Score (HBIS).\n\n- **Efficient Data Handling**: Ensuring that data handling was efficient, with appropriate storage methods for larger datasets, contributed to the success of experiments.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Incorrect Metric Calculations**: A recurring issue was the incorrect calculation of the Hydrogen Bonding Interaction Score (HBIS), which led to negative values. This was often due to using the negative mean squared error directly, which was not aligned with the expected behavior of metrics.\n\n- **Device Handling Errors**: Failures often stemmed from not moving input tensors and model parameters to the correct device (GPU/CPU), leading to issues during training.\n\n- **Dataset Handling Errors**: Several failures were due to incorrect handling of datasets, such as using placeholder strings instead of valid dataset names, leading to DatasetNotFoundError, or incorrect assumptions about dataset structure, resulting in TypeErrors.\n\n- **Lack of Input Normalization**: Not normalizing input features before passing them to the model was a common pitfall, potentially leading to suboptimal training performance.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Refine Metric Calculations**: Ensure that all metric calculations, especially for HBIS, are correctly implemented and aligned with expected behaviors. Avoid using metrics that can result in negative values unless explicitly intended.\n\n- **Robust Device Management**: Always verify that input tensors and model parameters are correctly moved to the designated device (GPU/CPU) to prevent execution errors.\n\n- **Proper Dataset Management**: Use valid dataset names and ensure datasets are preprocessed correctly to match the expected structure. Avoid using placeholders and inspect dataset structures before implementation.\n\n- **Implement Input Normalization**: Normalize input features consistently to improve model stability and performance during training.\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Tuning**: Continue to explore hyperparameter tuning, particularly for regularization techniques, to optimize model performance.\n\n- **Increase Dataset Size and Complexity**: Further increase dataset size and complexity to improve the model's ability to generalize and capture intricate patterns.\n\n- **Comprehensive Validation and Monitoring**: Maintain comprehensive validation steps and metric tracking to monitor performance closely and identify potential issues early in the training process.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on past successes and avoid common pitfalls, leading to more robust and effective research outcomes."
