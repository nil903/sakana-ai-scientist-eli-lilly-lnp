Problem: Investigating Non-covalent Interactions Between Oxidized Ionizable Lipids and siRNA in Lipid Nanoparticle Systems
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are clinically approved delivery vehicles for siRNA therapeutics. The ionizable lipid DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3) is a key component of approved formulations but contains bis-allylic unsaturated hydrocarbon tails susceptible to oxidation. Oxidation of these tails can produce conjugated dienone byproducts containing ketone functional groups. Understanding how such oxidative modifications affect lipid-RNA interactions within LNPs is important for predicting drug product stability and performance.
Run all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to answer the following research questions:
1.    Does the introduction of a ketone group into the MC3 lipid tail through oxidation create new hydrogen bonding interactions with encapsulated siRNA? If so, how do these tail-mediated interactions compare in magnitude to the established interactions between the ionizable amine headgroup and RNA?
2.    How do the radial distribution functions characterizing lipid-RNA proximity differ between native MC3 and its oxidized dienone byproduct?
3.    For siRNA containing 2'-OH groups (unmodified ribose), does the oxidized lipid species show additional interaction modes compared to fully 2'-O-methyl modified siRNA?
The system should include double-stranded siRNA with chemically modified backbones (phosphorothioate linkages) and sugar modifications (2'-O-methyl and 2'-fluoro), protonated ionizable lipid species, and aqueous solvent conditions representative of physiological buffer. Two separate simulation systems should be constructed for comparison: one with native MC3 molecules, and the other with oxidized MC3 dienone byproduct. The siRNA sequence to be used in this study is: sense strand 5’-uscscuauGfaCfUfGfua-gauuuusasu-3’ and antisense strand 5’-pasUfsaaaAfucuacagUfcA-fuaggasasu-3’. The chemical modifications are denoted as follows: a, c, g, u: 2’-O-Methyl nucleotides, s: phosphorothioate; Af, Cf, Gf, Uf: 2’-Fluoronucleotides, p: (mono)phosphate.
After conducting this research, write a research paper with introduction, results, discussion, methods, and references.
