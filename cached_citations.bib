% ['The first paper discusses interactions between ionizable amino lipids and a short RNA hairpin using molecular dynamics simulations, providing insights that could support my exploration of MC3 lipid interactions with siRNA. It can be cited in the section where I discuss the background on lipid-nucleic acid interactions.', 'The second paper employs all-atom molecular dynamics to investigate the interactions between single-stranded nucleic acids and a phospholipid bilayer, revealing important binding dynamics that could help contextualize my findings on hydrogen bonding dynamics in lipid nanoparticles. This can be referenced in the methods section, particularly when outlining the simulation techniques used.']
